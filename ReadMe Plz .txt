REQUIRED: Microsoft Sidebar, space.png, GIF.html, Gadget.xml

Put your gif in the bloody execution directory!

Your widget will be saved to %USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows Sidebar/Gadgets/.

Just put the name and extention of the gif. Don't put / before the name (/shit.gif) or it will break.

You can use this on images too.





Important bit:

Because Bill Gates is a shit head, the Sidebar only supports alpha coverage on .png files... so.......
the widget is a gif or other image file type on top of a 100% alpha coverage .png grid. Excluding the file
space.png will result in shitty gifs without alpha coverage. Blame Bill.
